Students who are in their last semester in college always face a great deal of choices. With certainty, how to select suitable teachers of certain classes has been a grave concern for those senior students. Some students present the argument that they would like to take the courses given by unfamiliar teachers, while others hold an opposite view by arguing that it is the familiar teachers that most fit them during the last semester. As far as I am concerned, I cling to the latter perspective.
